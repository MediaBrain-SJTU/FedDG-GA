## Requirements

- Python 3.9.7
- numpy 1.20.3
- torch 1.11.0
- torchvision 0.12.0

## Dataset

Firstly create directory for log files and change the dataset path (`pacs_path`, `officehome_path` and `terrainc_path`) and log path (`log_count_path`) in configs/default.py.
Please download the datasets from the official links:

- [PACS](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~dl307/project_iccv2017)
- [OfficeHome](https://hemanthdv.github.io/officehome-dataset)
- [TerraInc](https://beerys.github.io/CaltechCameraTraps)
- [DomainNet](http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/)

## Training from scratch

We release the code for PACS dataset and the other two benchmarks can be applied by only changing the dataloader_obj in data/{officehome, terrainc}_dataset.py. All the five FedDG methods are released (FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, AM, RSC).

Then running the code:

`
python algorithms/fedavg/train_pacs_GA.py --test_domain p --lr 0.001 --batch_size 16 --comm 40 --model resnet18 --note debug
`
